# comp115_project1

I wouldn't even be able to attend school had I not transitioned. I wanted to pay homage to the love and effort that it took for me to even be able to take this class (COMP115) and I wanted to surprise my partner with it as they are on the same journey I am. The idea is to begin with a "pole" on which I can hang a trans pride flag. For the flag itself I decided To begin with a square that would make up the whole area of the flag, so that sub-dividing that area into equal segments could be easily done. The drawing of those segments is broken down into two different functions to save the time it would have taken to winding the turtle back and forth and up and down. Each function also has the color built into it to save time that would be wasted searching for accepted colour names.
